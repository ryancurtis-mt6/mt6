      <h2 class="fade-in">About Meal Team 6</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">
        Meal Team Six (MT6) was founded on November 13, 2021 by a group of high school friends. What started as a joke in nomenclature quickly became an identifier—Meal Team Six equalled friendship and trust. Over time,
        the group has grown to include more friends from around the world—present in four countries and counting. But remember: it's not the club that makes us friends—you're already one by being here.
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in">
        When one hears of a breakfast club, they oftentimes assume it starts and ends at the table—but for us, that's only part of it. While Meal Team Six members do enjoy breakfast and have strong opinions on what makes the best breakfast food, 
        the real bread and butter is community. Meal Team Six is a community of easygoing, approachable, and friendly people. We strive to give people connection.
